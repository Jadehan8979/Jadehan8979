- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jadehan8979
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding language(Java, python etc)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java. I was assigned to work with a developer to improve a system at a company. 
      but I do not know any coding language. I learned GW-BASIC which I learned in elementary school before.
      That doesn't mean I can't code.
- ðŸ“« I try to study one by one slowly. I will study Java, JSP, MVC etc in that order, along with HTML/CS/JS.
